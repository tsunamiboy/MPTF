Application details
Name *
Your application name. This is used to attribute the source of a tweet
and in user-facing authorization screens. 32 characters max.
Description *
Your application description, which will be shown in user-facing
authorization screens. Between 10 and 200 characters max.
Website *
Your application's publicly accessible home page, where users can go to
download, make use of, or find out more information about your
application. This fully-qualified URL is used in the source attribution
for tweets created by your application and will be shown in user-facing
authorization screens.
(If you don't have a URL yet, just put a placeholder here but remember
to change it later.)
Callback URL
Where should we return after successfully authenticating? OAuth 1.0a
<https://dev.twitter.com/pages/oauth> applications should explicitly
specify their /oauth_callback/ URL on the request token step, regardless
of the value given here. To restrict your application from using
callbacks, leave this field blank.

Developer Rules of the Road

/Last Update: July 2, 2013./

//

Twitter maintains an open platform that supports the millions of people
around the world who are sharing and discovering what’s happening now.
We want to empower our ecosystem partners to build valuable businesses
around the information flowing through Twitter. At the same time, we aim
to strike a balance between encouraging interesting development and
protecting both Twitter’s and users’ rights.

So, we’ve come up with a set of Developer Rules of the Road (“*Rules*”)
that describes the policies and philosophy around what type of
innovation is permitted with the content and information shared on Twitter.

The Rules will evolve along with our ecosystem as developers continue to
innovate and find new, creative ways to use the Twitter API, so please
check back periodically to see the current version. Don’t do anything
prohibited by the Rules and talk to us if you think we should make a
change or give you an exception.

If your application will eventually need more than 1 million user
tokens, or you expect your embedded Tweets
<https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets> and embedded timelines
<https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines> to exceed 10 million
daily impressions, you will need to talk to us directly about your
access to the Twitter API as you may be subject to additional terms.
Furthermore, applications that attempt to replicate Twitter’s core user
experience (as described in Section I.5 below) will need our permission
to have more than 100,000 user tokens and are subject to additional terms.


    I. Twitter Content

1. All use of the Twitter API and content, documentation, code, and
related materials made available to you on or through Twitter (“*Twitter
Content*”) is subject to and must comply with these Rules. As a
reminder, you and your Service are subject to the Twitter Terms of
Service <http://twitter.com/tos>.

2. You may use the Twitter API and Twitter Content in connection with
the products or services you provide (your “*Service*”) to search,
display, analyze, retrieve, view, and submit information to or on
Twitter. You may use the Twitter name or logos
<https://twitter.com/logo>and other brand elements that Twitter makes
available in order to identify the source of Twitter Content (“*Twitter
Marks*”) subject to these Rules.

3. Your use of the Twitter API and Twitter Content are subject to
certain limitations on access, calls, and use as set forth in the Rules,
on dev.twitter.com, or as otherwise provided to you by Twitter. If
Twitter believes that you have attempted to exceed or circumvent these
limitations, your ability to use the Twitter API and Twitter Content may
be temporarily or permanently blocked. Twitter may monitor your use of
the Twitter API to improve the Twitter service and to ensure your
compliance with these Rules. In order to ensure visibility and
enforcement of these Rules, you may not use a single application API key
for multiple use cases, and you may not use multiple application API
keys for the same use case.

4. You will not attempt or encourage others to:

 1. sell, rent, lease, sublicense, redistribute, or syndicate access to
    the Twitter API or Twitter Content to any third party without prior
    written approval from Twitter.
      * If you provide downloadable datasets of Twitter Content or an
        API that returns Twitter Content, you may only return IDs
        (including tweet IDs and user IDs).
      * You may provide spreadsheet or PDF files or other export
        functionality via non­-programmatic means, such as using a “save
        as” button, for up to 100,000 public Tweets and/or User Objects
        per user per day. Exporting Twitter Content to a datastore as a
        service or other cloud based service, however, is not permitted.
 2. remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on the Twitter API
    or Twitter Content.
 3. use or access the Twitter API for purposes of monitoring the
    availability, performance, or functionality of any of Twitter’s
    products and services or for any other benchmarking or competitive
    purposes.
 4. use Twitter Marks or Twitter Certified Products Program badges in a
    manner that creates a sense of endorsement, sponsorship, or false
    association with Twitter. You may not use Twitter Marks as part of
    the name of your company or Service, or in any product, service,
    name field or logos created by you. All use of Twitter Marks, and
    all goodwill arising out of such use, will inure to Twitter’s benefit.
 5. use or access the Twitter API to aggregate, cache (except as part of
    a Tweet), or store place and other geographic location information
    contained in Twitter Content.
 6. charge a premium for access to Twitter Content via SMS or USSD other
    than your Service’s standard data and usage rates.

5. While Twitter discourages development in this area, some Services or
applications attempt to replicate Twitter’s core user experience,
typically by accessing the home timeline, account settings, or direct
messages API endpoints or User Streams
<https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/streams/user> product. The
following additional rules apply to Services or applications that fall
within this category.

You must:

 1. use the Twitter API as provided by Twitter
    <https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1> for functionalities in your
    Service that are substantially similar to a feature of the Twitter
    service and present this to your users as the default option. Some
    examples include media storage and sharing (pic.twitter.com),
    trending topics, and suggested user lists.
 2. not pay, or offer to pay, third parties for distribution. This
    includes offering compensation for downloads (other than
    transactional fees) or other mechanisms of traffic acquisition.
 3. not arrange for your Service to be pre-installed on any device,
    promoted as a “zero-rated” service, or marketed as part of a
    specialized data plan.
 4. not frame or otherwise reproduce significant portions of the Twitter
    service. You should display Twitter Content from the Twitter API.
 5. display a prominent link or button in your Service that directs new
    users to Twitter’s sign-up functionality.
 6. not use Twitter Content or other data collected from end users to
    create or maintain a separate status update or social network
    database or service.

6. You do not have a license to Twitter Content submitted through your
Service other than the rights granted in the Rules.


    II. Principles

You agree that you and your Service will follow these four principles:

  * Don’t surprise users
  * Don’t create or distribute spam
  * Respect user privacy
  * Be a good partner to Twitter


      1. Don’t surprise users

 1. You must maintain the integrity of Twitter Content (such as Tweets
    and timelines of Tweets) by adhering to the Display Requirements
    <https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements>.
 2. Get users’ permission before:
      * sending Tweets or other messages on their behalf. A user
        authenticating through your application does not constitute
        consent to send a message.
      * modifying their profile information or taking account actions
        (including following, unfollowing, and blocking) on their behalf.
      * adding hashtags, annotations data, or other content to a user’s
        Tweet. If your application allows users to send Tweets or other
        content to Twitter, show the user exactly what will be published.
      * republishing Twitter Content accessed through means other than
        via the Twitter API or other tools that may be provided to you
        by Twitter, or in a manner inconsistent with the Display
        Requirements <https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements>.
 3. Your Service should not:
      * use business names and/or logos in a manner that can mislead,
        confuse, or deceive users. For more information on use of
        Twitter Marks, see our trademark rules here
        <https://twitter.com/logo>
      * confuse or mislead users about the source or purpose of your
        application.
      * use as its Application Website URL: an unrelated URL, a site
        intended to entice or encourage users to violate the Twitter
        Rules, a spam or malware site, or a shortened URL to mask the
        true destination.
      * replicate, frame, or mirror the Twitter website or its design.
      * impersonate or facilitate impersonation of others in a manner
        that can mislead, confuse, or deceive users.
 4. Respect the privacy and sharing settings of Twitter Content. Do not
    share, or encourage or facilitate the sharing of protected Twitter
    Content. Promptly change your treatment of Twitter Content (for
    example, deletions, modifications, and sharing options) as changes
    are reported through the Twitter API.
 5. It is important for all users and Twitter API developers that we
    maintain the integrity and addressability of the Twitter identity
    across the ecosystem. If your Service submits content to Twitter
    that includes a username beginning with an “@” symbol, it must
    submit the correct Twitter username, if known by your Service.


      2. Don’t create or distribute spam

 1. Spam can take many forms. Please abide by the spam rules here
    <http://support.twitter.com/articles/18311#spam>.
 2. If your application performs automatic actions (including tweeting
    or other content updates), make sure you comply with the Automation
    Rules found here <http://support.twitter.com/articles/76915>.
 3. Do not mass-register applications. This includes:
      * creating tokens/applications for the purpose of preventing
        others from using or selling those names, or other commercial use.
      * using feeds of third-party content to update and maintain
        accounts under the names of those third parties.
      * submitting multiple applications with the same function under
        different names for the purpose of name squatting.
 4. Do not facilitate or encourage the publishing of:
      * links to malicious content
      * pornographic or obscene images to user profile images and
        background images


      3. Respect user privacy

 1. Your Service must display and comply with a privacy policy that is
    presented before download, installation or sign up (as applicable)
    that clearly discloses what you are doing with information you
    collect from users. If your Service supports cookies, your privacy
    policy must disclose that third parties may be placing and reading
    cookies on the systems of your users in the course of providing
    content to them. Your privacy policy should also provide information
    about user options for cookie management and the Do Not Track
    <https://support.twitter.com/articles/20169453>setting in supporting
    web browsers.
 2. Clearly disclose when you are adding location information to a
    user’s Tweets, whether as a geotag or annotations data. Be clear
    about whether you are adding a place or specific coordinates. If
    your application allows users to Tweet with their location be sure
    that it complies with the best practices found here
    <https://dev.twitter.com/terms/geo-developer-guidelines>.
 3. You should not solicit another developer’s consumer keys or consumer
    secrets especially if they will be stored or used for actions
    outside of that developer’s control. Keys and secrets that are
    compromised will be reset by Twitter. For example, online services
    that ask for these values in order to provide a “tweet-branding”
    service are not allowed.
 4. Do not facilitate or encourage the publishing of private or
    confidential information.
 5. Do not store Twitter passwords.
 6. Do not store non-public Twitter Content except at the explicit
    direction of a Twitter end user.
 7. As a reminder, Twitter’s services are not directed to persons under
    13. If you operate a commercial website or online service that is
    targeted to children, you must opt out of tailoring Twitter in any
    Twitter for Websites
    <https://dev.twitter.com/docs/twitter-for-websites> button, embedded
    Tweet, or embedded timeline on your website or service. You must set
    the opt-out parameter to be true, for example, as provided in the
    Tweet button documentation here
    <https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-button#optout>.


      4. Be a good partner to Twitter

 1. If you display Tweets in an offline context, do so according to the
    guidelines found here <http://support.twitter.com/articles/114233>.
 2. Respect the features and functionality embedded with or included in
    Twitter Content or the Twitter API. Do not attempt to interfere
    with, intercept, disrupt, filter, or disable any features of the
    Twitter API or Twitter service, including the content of embedded
    Tweets <https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets> and embedded
    timelines <https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-timelines>.
 3. You should only surface activity that is organically displayed on
    Twitter.
      * For example, your Service should execute the unfavorite and
        delete actions by removing all relevant messaging and Twitter
        Content, not by publicly displaying to other end users that the
        Tweet was unfavorited or deleted.
 4. If your application causes or induces user accounts to violate the
    Twitter Rules <http://support.twitter.com/articles/18311>(for
    example, by retweeting spam updates, repeatedly posting duplicate
    links, etc.), it may be suspended or terminated. We’ve provided some
    guidance in our Abuse Prevention and Security help page
    <http://support.twitter.com/articles/79901>.
 5. Respect the intellectual property rights of others.
 6. Do not use the Twitter Verified Account badge, Verified Account
    status, or any other enhanced user categorization on Twitter Content
    other than that reported to you by Twitter through the API.
 7. Twitter may suspend or revoke access if we believe you are in
    violation of the Rules or the spirit of these principles. If you are
    suspended, do not apply for or register additional API tokens.


    III. Twitter Functionality in your Service


      1. Twitter Login

End users must be presented with the option to log into Twitter via the
OAuth protocol. End users without a Twitter account should be given the
opportunity to create a new Twitter account as provided by Twitter. You
must display the Connect with Twitter option at least as prominently as
the most prominent of any other third party social networking sign-up or
sign-in marks and branding appearing on your Service.


      2. General

 1. If you allow end users to create social updates from your own social
    service or a third party social networking, micro-blogging, or
    status update provider integrated into your Service (“*Update*”),
    you must also display a prominent option to publish that content (or
    a link if the Update is not text or longer than 140 characters) to
    Twitter. Only link back to the same Update or content on the other
    service if the Update is longer than 140 characters.
 2. All URLs referencing content in the Update (for example, a web page,
    photo, video, or text longer than 140 characters) should direct
    users back to the page where that content is displayed, rather than
    any interstitial or intermediate page. You can require users to
    sign-in to access that page, but the content cannot otherwise be
    restricted from being viewed.


      3. Twitter Identity

Once an end user has authenticated via Connect with Twitter, you must
clearly display the end user’s Twitter identity. Twitter identity
includes visible display of the end user’s avatar, Twitter user name,
and the Twitter “bird” mark. Displays of the end user’s followers on
your Service must clearly show that the relationship is associated with
the Twitter service.


    IV. Commercial Use

It is our goal to provide you, our ecosystem partner, with a policy that
is clear and transparent about what you can do to monetize your Service.
This is best summed up in two principles:

  * respect user content — Tweets may be used in advertisements, not as
    advertisements.
  * respect user experience — build your service around the timeline,
    not in the timeline.

 1. *Twitter Ads*. Twitter reserves the right to serve advertising via
    its APIs (“*Twitter Ads*”). If you decide to serve Twitter Ads once
    we start delivering them, we will share a portion of advertising
    revenue with you per our then-current terms and conditions.
 2. *Advertising Around Twitter Content*
     1. We encourage you to create advertising opportunities around
        Twitter content that are compliant with these Rules. In cases
        where Twitter Content is the primary basis of the advertising
        sale, we require you to compensate us (recoupable against any
        fees payable to Twitter for data licensing). For example, you
        may sell sponsorships or branding around gadgets or iframes that
        include Tweets and other customized visualizations of Twitter
        with prior permission.
     2. You may generally advertise around and on sites that display
        Tweets, but you may not place any advertisements within the
        Twitter timeline on your Service other than Twitter Ads.
     3. Your advertisements cannot resemble or reasonably be confused by
        users as a Tweet. For example, ads cannot have Tweet actions
        like follow, retweet, favorite, and reply. And you cannot sell
        or receive compensation for Tweet actions or the placement of
        Tweet actions on your Service.
     4. You may advertise in close proximity to the Twitter timeline
        (e.g., banner ads above or below timeline), but there must be a
        clear separation between Twitter content and your advertisements.
 3. *Using Twitter Content*. Get the users’ permission before:
      * using their content on a commercial durable good or product (for
        example, using a Tweet on a t-shirt or a poster or making a book
        based on someone’s Tweets);
      * creating an advertisement that implies the sponsorship or
        endorsement on behalf of the user; or
      * using content in a manner that is inconsistent with the Display
        Requirements
        <https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements> and would
        require the user’s permission under applicable law, including
        without limitation uses of Twitter Content that features the
        name, likeness, or identifying persona of a person.


    V. Other Legal Terms


      1. Termination.

You may terminate any license in these Rules at any time by ceasing your
access to the Twitter API and use of any Twitter Content, and deleting
all copies of the Twitter API and Twitter Content as described below.
Twitter may immediately suspend your access to the Twitter API or any
Twitter Content (or if necessary, terminate this agreement with you) at
any time, and without notice to you if you breach any term or condition
in the Rules or otherwise engage in activities that Twitter reasonably
determines are likely to cause liability to Twitter. Twitter may also
terminate any licenses hereunder for any reason (including by email to
the address associated with your account). Twitter will not be liable
for any costs, expenses, or damages as a result of its termination of
this agreement. Upon termination of this agreement, you will promptly
cease accessing and using the Twitter API and Twitter Content and will
delete all Twitter Content and any information derived therefrom and all
copies and portions thereof, in all forms and types of media from your
Service. Sections 1(4) and V of these Rules will survive the termination
of this agreement.


      2. Confidentiality.

You may be given access to certain non-public information, software, and
specifications relating to the Twitter API (“Confidential Information”),
which is confidential and proprietary to Twitter. You may use this
Confidential Information only as necessary in exercising your rights
granted in these Rules. You may not disclose any of this Confidential
Information to any third party without Twitter’s prior written consent.
You agree that you will protect this Confidential Information from
unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that you
would use to protect your own confidential and proprietary information
of a similar nature and in any event with no less than a reasonable
degree of care.


      3. Ownership; Feedback.

3.1 /Twitter/. You expressly acknowledge that Twitter and its end users
retain all worldwide right, title and interest in and to the Twitter
Content, including all intellectual property rights therein. You also
acknowledge that as between you and Twitter, Twitter owns all right,
title and interest in and to the Twitter API, Twitter Marks, and the
Twitter service (and any derivative works or enhancements thereof),
including but not limited to all intellectual property rights therein.
You agree not to do anything inconsistent with such ownership. Any
rights not expressly granted herein are withheld. You agree that you
will not challenge Twitter’s ownership of, the validity of any license
to use, or otherwise copy or exploit the Twitter Marks during or after
the termination of this agreement except as specifically authorized
herein. If you acquire any rights in the Twitter Marks or any
confusingly similar marks, by operation of law or otherwise, you will,
at no expense to Twitter, immediately assign such rights to Twitter.

3.2 /You/. As between you and Twitter, you retain all worldwide right,
title and interest in and to your Service, excluding the Twitter API,
Twitter Marks, and the Twitter Service (and any derivative works or
enhancements thereof), including but not limited to all intellectual
property rights therein. You may provide Twitter with comments
concerning the Twitter Content or Twitter API or your evaluation and use
thereof. You agree that Twitter and its designees will be free to copy,
modify, create derivative works, publicly display, disclose, distribute,
license and sublicense, incorporate, and otherwise use the feedback,
including derivative works thereto, for any and all commercial and
non-commercial purposes with no obligation of any kind to you.


      4. Updates.

Twitter may update or modify the Twitter API, Rules, and other terms and
conditions, including the Display Requirements
<https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements>, from time to time
at its sole discretion by posting the changes on this site or by
otherwise notifying you (such notice may be via email). You acknowledge
that these updates and modifications may adversely affect how your
Service accesses or communicates with the Twitter API. If any change is
unacceptable to you, your only recourse is to terminate this agreement
by ceasing all use of the Twitter API and Twitter Content. Your
continued access or use of the Twitter API or any Twitter Content will
constitute binding acceptance of the change.


      5. Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer.

5.1 /Representations and Warranties/. You represent and warrant that:

 1. you have the necessary power and authority to enter into this
    agreement, and that the performance of your obligations will not
    constitute a breach or otherwise violate any other agreement or the
    rights of any third party arising therefrom;
 2. you will maintain throughout the term of this agreement all rights
    and licenses that are required with respect to your Service; and
 3. your Service and its use, distribution, sale and license, including
    the use of any license hereunder, does and will continue to comply
    with all applicable foreign, federal, state, and local laws, rules,
    and regulations.

5.2 /Disclaimer/. THE TWITTER CONTENT, TWITTER API, AND ANY OTHER
TWITTER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”
AND ON AN “AS-AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TWITTER
DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR
OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
NONINFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. TWITTER
DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE TWITTER CONTENT AND TWITTER API AND ANY OTHER
TWITTER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER WILL MEET ALL OF YOUR
REQUIREMENTS OR THAT USE OF SUCH TWITTER CONTENT AND TWITTER API BE
ERROR-FREE UNINTERRUPTED, VIRUS-FREE, OR SECURE.


      6. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT WILL TWITTER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE,
DATA, BUSINESS OR PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE TWITTER API, TWITTER CONTENT, OR OTHER
TWITTER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY
CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT
LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL
SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT
IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN ANY CASE, TWITTER’S
AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF
ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) OR THE AGGREGATE FEES YOU PAID FOR ACCESS TO
THE TWITTER API IN THE LAST YEAR.


      7. Indemnification.

You will indemnify, defend, and hold Twitter, its subsidiaries,
affiliates, officers, and employees, harmless from any and all claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, actions, judgments, costs, and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees) brought by a third party arising
out of or in connection with: (a) any act or omission by you, in
connection with your use of the Twitter Content, the Twitter API, or the
Twitter Marks; (b) your use of the Twitter Content, the Twitter API, or
the Twitter Marks other than as expressly allowed by this agreement; (c)
your breach or alleged breach of any of the terms, restrictions,
obligations or representations under this agreement; or (d) your
Service. You will assume control of the defense and settlement of any
claim subject to indemnification by you. Twitter may, however, at any
time elect to take over control of the defense and settlement of any
such claim. In any event, you will not settle any such claim without
Twitter’s prior written consent.


      8. Miscellaneous.

These Rules constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter and supersedes and merges all prior
proposals, understandings and contemporaneous communications. Any
modification to the Rules by you must be in a writing signed by both you
and Twitter. You may not assign any of the rights or obligations granted
hereunder, voluntarily or by operation of law (including without
limitation in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets)
except with the express written consent of Twitter, and any attempted
assignment in violation of this paragraph is void. This agreement does
not create or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture. This
agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of California, without regard to or application of
conflicts of law rules or principles. All claims arising out of or
relating to this agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal or
state courts of San Francisco County, California, USA, and you consent
to personal jurisdiction in those courts. No waiver by Twitter of any
covenant or right under this agreement will be effective unless
memorialized in a writing duly authorized by Twitter. If any part of
this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court
of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the
maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of this
agreement will remain in full force and effect.
